I needed a two-column layout with a scrolling sidebar to publish my [code cheatsheets](http://karloespiritu.com/cheatsheets), and found the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) Jekyll theme to be a good starting theme. To complement the color scheme of my main [website](http://karloespiritu.com), I customised the theme to make it look great in black background and changed the sidebar to display scrolling content. I created this theme because I can't seem to find any good Jekyll theme with a master-detail layout. Hopefully, someone will find this useful as well in their own projects.
